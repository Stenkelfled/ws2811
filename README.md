# ws2811
WS2811 LED microcontroller driver with USB-connection and UserInterface for PC

Another Project for a WS2811 LED-strip. The clue here is, that the controller board is accessible via USB and that you can control the LEDs from you PC/Laptop.

Includes:
- Electronics design with ATXMEGA
- code for the xmega
- an UserInterface for a pc to communicate with the microcontroller written with Qt
